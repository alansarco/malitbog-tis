                            Malitbog, a town in the Philippines, was established in the 18th century by the Spanish. The town was divided into two barangays, one in Barangay Caaga and the other in Barangay Abgaom, which were ruled by their respective chieftains, called "captines." The rivalry between the two barangays led to confusion, and the name "MALITBOG" was given to the established pueblo. In 1857, a baroque-style Roman Catholic Church was built in the middle of the two barangays, with the demarcation line serving as the line. In 1862, a "carcel" was constructed to warn settlers from Moro pirate attacks. Malitbog was recognized under the Muara.

                        Under the Law of 1893, Malitbog was reorganized under the Maura Law of 1893, which granted towns and provinces greater autonomy and the establishment of "tribunales municipals" and "junta provincial." The town's territorial limits covered 19 kilometers south of the Poblacion, including the island of Limasawa. During the American regime, Malitbog was recognized under Act No. 82, known as the Municipal Code, and the first Municipal President was Francisco Esca√±o. The town's Municipal Hall was later transferred to another private house. In 1957, the Municipality of Padre Burgos was created, and in 1969, several barrios to the north were transferred under the jurisdiction of the newly-created Municipality of Tomas Oppus.
